🚀 Amazon Clone (Old Project)
I'm so proud to finally push this project to GitHub! 🎉 This is one of the first React apps I ever built using Create React App. Even though it's not modern or perfect, it's a part of my learning journey, and I want to keep it as a reminder of how far I've come.

🏗️ About This Project
This was built when I was still exploring React and front-end development.
It's a basic Amazon Clone—just a fun attempt at recreating an e-commerce UI.
It may not follow best practices, but it represents my struggles and growth in web development.
🛠️ Tech Stack
React.js (Created using Create React App)
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
🚧 Why I Uploaded It
✅ To remind myself where I started.
✅ To show that learning is a process.
✅ To appreciate the work I did back then.

💡 Looking Back: If I were to rebuild this project today, I’d probably use Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript—but for now, I want to celebrate what I made back then. 🚀
