# 🛒 Amazon Clone (My First React Project) 🚀  

This project is **a milestone in my coding journey**! 🎉  
I built this Amazon Clone when I was **still learning React**, struggling with state management, components, and styling. It may not be modern, but it represents my **dedication, progress, and passion for web development**.  

Even though it's simple, I’m proud to finally **push it to GitHub** and preserve it as part of my growth. 💪

## 🎯 **Project Overview**  
✅ Built with **Create React App** – the easiest way to start React back then.  
✅ A basic e-commerce UI inspired by Amazon.  
✅ Features like product listings, shopping cart (basic logic), and a simple design.  
✅ Fully built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no fancy frameworks).**  

### 🔍 **Tech Stack Used (Back Then)**  
- **React.js** (Created using Create React App)  
- **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**  
- **Basic State Management (useState, useEffect)**

## 🔥 **If I Were to Build This Today...**  
If I had to **recreate** this project now, I would use:  

🚀 **Next.js** – for better performance and SEO.  
🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – for a modern, responsive UI.  
🔍 **TypeScript** – for type safety and scalability.  
🛒 **Redux Toolkit or Zustand** – for efficient state management.  
🔧 **Backend with Node.js & Express** – for real e-commerce functionality.  
🔐 **Firebase/Auth0** – for authentication.  

The old project may not have these, but it's a **reminder of where I started and how much I’ve learned!**
